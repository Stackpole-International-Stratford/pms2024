Calling bootstrap locally by the way like this
<link href={% static "bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" %} rel="stylesheet">
<script src={% static "bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" %}></script>

I need a Title Row (row #1) (1 column) Where I can insert a title for the form page


The next row (Row #2) will be a header row (3 columns, each of 3 columns will have 2 rows)
        Column 1/3 will have Date in row 1 and Qty Inspected input fields in row 2
        Column 2/3 will have Operators in row 1 and Total Defects input fields in row 2
        Column 3/3 will have Shift input fields in row 1 and Total accepted in row 2 input fields


The next row (Row #3) will contain a grid inside of it
Inside this grid will be 3 columns. 
    Column 1/3 will be called Feat Name
    Column 2/3 will be called No. of Defects.
    Column 3/3 will be called Comments

    The number of rows in this grid will be dynamic based on how many different types of defects are loaded into the page, but for now let's assume it's static. 
    List of defects includes: Window Height
    Pinion Hole Diameter
    Burrs
    Plate Spline Tooth Thickness O/S 
    Plate Spline Major Diameter 
    Damaged / Missing Teeth 
    Dings / Dents 
    Stuck Debur Media
