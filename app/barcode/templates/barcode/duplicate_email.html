<body>
    <p>A duplicate part has been scanned at AB1V or 10R140 100% inspection table.</p>
    
    <p><strong>{{ barcode }}</strong> was previously scanned at <strong>{{ scan_time }}</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>You need to go to the station and investigate:</p>
    
    <p>If the first scan occurred more than 15 minutes ago (Is it likely to still be at the station?):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrap the part in question</li>
        <li>Unlock the station and the operators can resume normal production</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If the first scan occurred less than 15 minutes ago:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have the operator go back through the skid and see if there was indeed a duplicate part</li>
        <li>If a duplicate is found, take both parts, Red Tag them, and send them to QA for investigation.</li>
        <li>If it is determined that the operator scanned the same part twice, unlock the station and the operators can resume normal production.</li>
    </ul>
